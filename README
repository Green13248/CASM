CASM stands for something asm, it is a "compiler" for BISC machines and was written in c++

How to use:

Setup, ignore windows defender or whatever it's fine and safe.

put CASM in the folder or desktop where your source code is:

make a folder, example:
Myproject:
    CASM.exe
    thing.txt

You will be greeted with a ">" carat.

Type h for help if you need it (It does not do anything)

Type "bin" to compile your source code into something compiled.
    
Next, name your sourcecode file WITH the extention at the end (ex: thing.txt) (Write the .txt at the end)

Name the file you want to be made with the .txt at the end (ex: compiled.txt)

Myproject:
    CASM.exe
    thing.txt
    compiled.txt



enjoy your cool new BISC machine code file...
